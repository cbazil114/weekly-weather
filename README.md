* **WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* **THEN** I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* **WHEN** I view future weather conditions for that city
* **THEN** I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* **WHEN** I click on a city in the search history
* **THEN** I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Steps

Creating a functioning system required finding the correct way to fetch the API url. A programmer would need to make an account on the site to get the appropriate API key to access the necessary information. It is also important to consider what you will be displaying. For example, I used fahrenheit since I live in the United States, therefore you need to include units=imperial in the parameters.

Most of the functions in the JavaScript will help build the necessary foundation of the webpage display. Without it, there is only a couple of headers and a search bar.
